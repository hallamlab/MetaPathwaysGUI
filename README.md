# MetaPathways v2.0 GUI
Niels W. Hanson, Kishori M. Konwar, Shang-Ju Wu, and Steven J. Hallam

## About
This repository contains the GUI code that drives the MetaPathways 2.0 python codebase. 

The codebase is constantly being updated with additions in features, so users should take care in pulling unless they wish try the newest features as well.

Please see the [MetaPathways v2.0 repository](https://github.com/hallamlab/metapathways2) for the accompanying MetaPathways v2.0 python files.

If you choose to compile your own version of the GUI, simply replace the GUI executable in the python repository with your own compiled binary and change your MetaPathways2 setup paths, if necessary.

## Dependencies
- Qt 5.2.1 clang 64bit
